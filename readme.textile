h1. MMFirmware - The embedded g-code interpreter that controls the MezzoMill.
    
The MMFirmware is derived from Grbl. It has been extended to handle homing and spindle control.

I invented a novel capacitive homing method to allow for precise and consistent homing. I started with the excellent CapSense Arduino sketch. I then re-wrote that in c and added some significant low pass filtering so that I am able to ensure that I get consistent results.
